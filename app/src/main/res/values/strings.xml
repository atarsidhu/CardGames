    <string name="go_fish_overview">Go Fish is a game of chance, with a healthy dose of reasoning. Played with a single deck of cards, players take turns guessing a card that they think the other player may
    hold, and taking them for themselves if they guess correctly. Points are scored by collecting pairs of the same card value (e.g. an Ace of Hearts and an Ace of Clubs).</string>
    <string name="go_fish_setup">A player is randomly chosen to be the dealer. Starting with the player after them, each player is dealt seven (7) cards. \n\n</string>
    <string name="go_fish_gameplay">
        1.  The player after the dealer may ask a player if they have cards of a certain rank (e.g. \"Do you have any Aces?\").\n\n
        1a. If they don\'t, then the player who asked must draw the top card from the deck, and the turn passes.\n\n
        1b. If they do, then those cards are given to the asking player from the other player\'s hand. The asking player may ask for another rank.\n\n
        2.  After receiving cards, either from another player or from the deck, a player may search for pairs of cards within their hand. A pair is any two cards of the same rank, regardless of suit.
        If any pairs are found, they are removed from the game, and that player scores a point for each pair found.
    </string>
    <string name="go_fish_winning">A game is completed once there are no more cards left to draw, and one of the players has emptied their hand. The player with the most points wins.</string>
